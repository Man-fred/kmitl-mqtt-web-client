This client runs on any modern browser, which supports websockets (sorry Internet Explorer <10!).
You can use it to publish and subscribe at the same time.

## How to use it

## Localhost / Local network

You can also use this client to connect to a broker on your local machine ("localhost") or any machine in your local network which is reachable from the machine which your browser runs on.

## Can I embedd it / ship it with my software?

We are fork from [HiveMQ Web Client](https://github.com/hivemq/hivemq-mqtt-web-client "HiveMQ Web Client")

And HiveMQ says!, "Sure! We would however be very glad if you would honor the work by linking to the original client source or mentioning that this websocket client was developed initially for HiveMQs websocket support."
